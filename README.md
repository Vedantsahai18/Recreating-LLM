# LLama3 and GPT-2 Recreation

This repository contains code and resources for recreating LLama3 and GPT-2 models, inspired by the work of Andrej Karpathy. Specifically, we are referring to his repositories and code provided in the [Neural Networks: Zero To Hero](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html) video lecture series.

## Repository Overview

The purpose of this repository is to provide a hands-on implementation of LLama3 and GPT-2, following the methodologies and coding practices demonstrated by Andrej Karpathy. The project aims to recreate the models while allowing for easy hacking, exploration, and learning.

## Reference Repositories

1. **nanoGPT-Lecture**
   - Code created in the [Neural Networks: Zero To Hero](https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html) video lecture series, specifically on the first lecture on nanoGPT.
   - GitHub Repo: [nanoGPT model.py](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT/blob/master/model.py)
   - Note: Model initialization is crucial for good performance. The current code will train and work fine, but its convergence is slower due to starting off in a suboptimal weight space. Future updates may cover these parts in more detail.
